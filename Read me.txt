Dear Admission Committee£º

Thank you for reviewing my portfolio.

It is one of my curriculum design projects. I finished it in summer semester of 2017. 

I included project files, presentation ppt in this folder. I am sorry that I did not prepare an English version of my presentation ppt, so I uploaded a video showing the functions of my system. Because it is a group project, so there are 4 parts in the video, and the first one is mine. May it be helpful.


Sincerely,

Ying Xu
